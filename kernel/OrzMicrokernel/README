Orz Microkernel - version 0.rz

Orz Microkernel is a tiny microkernel written in 80386 Protected
Mode Assembly with message-based design. Orz Microkernel is 
inspired by Minix[1], and the detailed messages are as following:
  . Sleep
  . GetTickCount
  . FindTaskByName
  . RmodeInt (Real mode interrupt routines used for VGA/MMU)
  . EnumTasksID
  . GetTaskName
  . KillTask
  . Exit
  . GetScanCode

The interrupts are as following:
  . int 0x30 - GetMessage
  . int 0x31 - SendMessageW
  . int 0x32 - ProcessMessage
  . int 0x33 - RemoveMessage
  . int 0x34 - SendAnswer

Orz Microkernel is licensed under BSD-like license. See the file
"LICENSE.txt" for details.

Additionally, Orz Microkernel includes a complete operating system
environment, which provides a small bootloader, disk utility, shell,
and sample programs ("Hello World" and floppy dumper). All of them
require NASM[2] to get built, and it is recommended to use qemu[3]
for testing. Refer to the script file "run.sh" to know how to launch
the distribution.
