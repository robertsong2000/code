* Indentation is in the 1TBS variant of K&R style, with the execption that functions have their opening brace on the same line as the function declaration.
    * There should be a space before an opening brace
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS
    * Example:

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        ...
        while (x == y) {
            something();
            somethingelse();

            if (some_error) {
                do_correct();
            }
            else {
                continue_as_usual();
            }
        }

        finalthing();
        ...
    }

* Macros are in ALL_CAPS
* The preferred naming convention is lower_case_with_userscores
    * Caps are fine if referencing something uppercase, like a register
* Dereferences go with variable name, not type (char *name)
