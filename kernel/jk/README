JK is distributed under terms described in the GNU General Public License.

JK (Just the Kernel) is derived from RJK, a kernel for The JOS Project 
(http://www.jos.org/), with more extensibility and well portibility 
targeted to be a light-weight kernel, self-contained, including the JVM 
image and any needed modules as an implementation of all the required 
functions of the Kernel Interface.
 
Currently, JK only runs under x86 processors and was built under Linux 
systems. Also, JK uses GRUB as it's boot loader, allowing it to load the
kernel and modules from ext2 or fat formated hard or floppy disks. 

The kernel has support for the following features:

	* Atomic Operations
	* IO Ports
	* Threads
	* Interrupts
	* Virtual Memory
	* Linear Memory
	* Loading Modules
	* Getting/Setting Time
	* Timers
	* Spinlock's
	* Mutex's
	* Printing Debug Messages
